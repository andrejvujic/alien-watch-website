      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p><b>Omnitrix doesn't collect any user data.</b></p>

      <p>
        User data collection isn't even possible for us because we don't have a
        place to store the data as we don't have a database. We don't own a
        server where the database could be hosted. Even this website relies on a
        3rd party service, Firebase Hosting, to be online.
      </p>

      <p>
        No analytics software, service or tool like Google Analytics is being
        used in the app and we have no insight in any information about the
        users of our app.
      </p>

      <p>
        The app itself is completely static and there isn't any form of
        user-generated content, so there isn't really anything about the users
        of our app which we could keep track of and store.
