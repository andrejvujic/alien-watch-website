    <h3>Fusion Transformations</h3>
    <p>
      You can now perform Fusion transformations like in
      <a href="https://ben10.fandom.com/wiki/Dr._Animo_and_the_Mutant_Ray"
        >Dr. Animo and the Mutant Ray</a
      >. All three aliens seen in that episode are available: Heat jaws, Diamond
      matter and Stink arms.
    </p>

    <h3>Voice Commands</h3>
    <p>
      Prototype mode now supports voice input. You can use your voice to
      activate certain features instead of using their activation codes. You can
      find all available voice commands and how to use them on the
      <a
        href="https://omnitrix-watch.web.app/documents/how-to-use.html#voice-commands"
        >official guide</a
      >.
    </p>

    <h3>More Voice Sound Effects</h3>
    <p>
      In the previous update alien voice sound effects were added for Ultimate
      Transformations. With this update almost all aliens will scream their name
      (with a special animation) when performing Regular Transformations in
      Recalibrated mode.
    </p>

    <h3>Life Form Lock</h3>
    <p>
      Starting with this update Omniverse transformations are limited to only 10
      seconds. In order to stay transformed longer you need to enable Life Form
      Lock. It's got a unique activation sequence which you can find out more
      about on the
      <a
        href="https://omnitrix-watch.web.app/documents/how-to-use.html#omniverse"
        >official guide</a
      >.
    </p>

    <h3>Selector Speed Settings</h3>
    <p>
      You can now change the speed of the alien selection animations in
      Ultimatrix and Omniverse using the
      <a
        href="https://omnitrix-watch.web.app/documents/how-to-use.html#preferences-editor"
        >Preferences Editor</a
      >.
