      <h1>Prototype</h1>
      <p>
        Prototype mode is the deafult mode. You can return to Prototype mode
        while in <a href="#ultimatrix">Ultimatrix mode</a> by using the
        Ultimatrix mode activation sequence. <br /><br />
        In Prototype mode you have access to the 10 original aliens by default.
        The default transformation and cooldown durations are 30 seconds, but
        can be customized using the Alien Watch Companion app for Android or
        using the <a href="#preferences-editor">Preferences Editor</a> on your
        Wear OS device. <br /><br />Prototype mode contains two other sub-modes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Master Control</li>
        <li>Self Destruction</li>
        <li>Virtual Reality transformations</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Prototype Master Control</h3>
      <p>
        Activation sequence: L, R, L, R, L, R, L, R, L, R.
        <br />
        <br />
        In Master Control mode you gain access to a total of 55 aliens.<br /><br />
        The transformations are infinite, meaning that you can stay transformed
        how long you want! Cooldowns don't require you wait before being able to
        transform again, meaning that you can exit cooldown whenever you like.
        <br /><br />There's also a quick transformation feature which you can
        use by long pressing the screen when your Omnitrix is locked.
      </p>
      <h3>Prototype Self Destruction</h3>
      <p>
        Activation sequence: L, L, R, R, L, L, R, R, L, L.
        <br />
        <br />
        There are multiple phases in the Self Destruction sequence. After all of
        the phases are completed your Omnitrix will be explode! To cancel the
        Self Destruction you can use the same sequence you used to activate it.
      </p>
      <h3>Prototype Fusion transformations</h3>
      <p>
        Activation sequence: L, R, L, R, R, L, R, L, R, R
        <br />
        <br />
        After using the activation code you will first go through the activation
        animation. After the animation finishes you can click the center of the
        screen to perform the transformation. Just make sure that you attempt to
        perform the transformation when there's no electricity on the screen!
        <br />
        <br />
        To exit Fusion mode long press the screen in stead of clicking.
        <br />
        <br />

    <section id="ultimatrix">
      <h1>Ultimatrix</h1>
      <p>
        Activation sequence: L, L, L, R, L, R, L, R, L, R.
        <br />
        <br />
        You can activate Ultimatrix by using it's activation sequence when in
        <a href="#prototype">Prototype mode</a>. You can also return to
        Ultimatrix mode from <a href="#omniverse">Omniverse mode</a> by using
        the Omniverse mode activation sequence.
        <br />
        <br />
        In Ultimatrix mode you have access to a total of 34 aliens. You can
        perform ultimate transformations with 9 of those aliens, while 22 scream
        their name when performing a normal transformation.
        <br />
        <br />
        Aliens which currently scream their name when transforming: Swampfire,
        Humungousaur, Spidermonkey, Big Chill, Jetray, Ghostfreak, Chromastone,
        Brainstorm, Way Big, Alien X, Cannonbolt, Diamondhead, Terraspin,
        Armodrillo, NRG, Ampfibian, Ghostfreak, Chamalien, Eatle, Fasttrack,
        Clockwork, Juryrigg.
        <br />
        <br />

        You can disable the sound effects of aliens screaming their voices using
        the
        <a href="#preferences-editor">Preferences Editor</a>.

        <br />
        <br />

        Ultimatrix mode contains three other sub-modes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Master Control</li>
        <li>Self Destruction</li>
        <li>Ultimate Trasnformations (Evolved Forms)</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Ultimatrix Master Control</h3>
      <p>
        Activation sequence: L, R, L, R, L, R, L, R, L, R.
        <br /><br />
        Master Control enables quick transformations and ultimate
        transformations. To perform quick transformations you need to long press
        the screen when the Ultimatrix is locked. Read more about ultimate
        transformations below.
        <br />
        <br />
        Unlike Prototype mode where the Master Control state is persisent in
        Ultimatrix mode you need to activate Master Control every time you open
        the app.
      </p>
      <h3>Azmuth Easter Egg</h3>
      <p>
        Ultimatrix Master Control contains a little easter egg. When you attempt
        to activate Master Control there's a 20% chance that the activation will
        fail. If that happens Azmuth will appear on the screen warning you about
        messing with the Omnitrix.
      </p>
      <h3>Ultimatrix Self Destruction</h3>
      <p>
        Activation sequence: L, L, R, R, L, L, R, R, L, L.
        <br />
        <br />
        There are multiple phases in the Self Destruction sequence. The complete
        sequence lasts about 30 seconds not including the activation animation.
        After all of the phases are completed your Omnitrix will be explode!
        <br />
        <br />
        In the Ultimatrix Self Destruction sequence there's also a countdown.
        The Ultimatrix speaks to let you know how much time's left before the
        detonation.
        <br />
        <br />
        To cancel the Self Destruction you can use the same sequence you used to
        activate it. But, make sure you cancel on time because you can't abort
        if there's less than five seconds on the countdown.
      </p>
      <h3>Ultimate Transformations</h3>
      <p>
        Ultimate transformations are available only when Master Control is
        enabled.
        <br />
        <br />
        After performing the regular transformation instead of clicking the
        screen, to go into cooldown, you need to long press the screen. The
        ultimate transformation sound effect and animation will play, after
        which the evolved alien will appear.
        <br />
        <br />
        Aliens which support ultimate transformations: Swampfire, Humangosaur,
        Spidermonkey, Big Chill, Echo Echo, Ghostfreak, Way Big, Cannonbolt,
        Wildmutt.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can disable the Ultimate Transformation voices (eg. "Ultimate
        Swampfire!") using the
        <a href="#preferences-editor">Preferences Editor</a>.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="omniverse">
      <h1>Omniverse</h1>
      <p>
        Activation sequence: R, R, R, L, R, L, R, L, R, L.
        <br />
        <br />
        You can activate Omniverse by using it's activation sequence when in
        <a href="#ultimatrix">Ultimatrix mode</a>.
        <br />
        <br />
        To show the selector and start switching aliens you need to long press
        the screen. Once the selector is visible you must not take your finger
        of the screen.
        <br />
        <br />
        To switch aliens to the right (clockwise) you need to drag your finger
        to the right side of the screen. To switch aliens to the left
        (counter-clockwise) you need to drag your finger to the left side of the
        screen.
        <br />
        <br />
        Once you select the alien you want to transform into, bring your finger
        to the center of the screen and lift it of the screen. You will hear a
        beeping sound. To perform the actual transformation you need to tap the
        center of the screen one more time.
        <br />
        <br />
        Omniverse contains one other sub-mode:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Randomizer Function</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Randomizer Function</h3>
      <p>
        Activation sequence: R, L, L, L, R, R, L, L, L, R.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Randomizer function can be activated when your Omnitrix is locked.
        After activating the Randomizer Function you will get a random alien
        about every 15 seconds. You can disable the Randomizer function by using
        the same sequence you used to activate it.
      </p>
      <h3>Life Form Lock</h3>
      <p>
        Activation sequence: L, L, L, R, R, R, L, L, L, L.
        <br />
        <br />
        Omniverse transformations only last 10 seconds. However, you can stay
        transformed how long you want by activating Life Form Lock using the
        above mentioned activation sequence.
        <br /><br />
        To activate Life Form Lock, first select an alien using the selector
        wheel. Once you have selected the alien and you start hearing the
        continous beeping sound you need to long press the screen. The screen
        content should shrink and now you can use the above mentioned activation
        sequence to activate Life Form Lock. You can return to the previous
        state (eg. cancel Life Form Lock activation) by long pressing the screen
        again.
        <br /><br />
        When Life Form Lock is activated you won't transform back automatically
        until you remove the Life Form Lock cover. You can do that by dragging
        the cover (swiping on your screen) towards the top of the screen.

      <p>Voice commands are currently available only in Prototype mode.</p>
      <p>
        To activate voice commands you need to long press the right side of the
        screen. After doing that you will be prompted to say the phrase which
        identifies the voice command you want execute.
      </p>

        * – After you say the activation phrase the exact same text as shown in
        the right column in the table above must appear on the screen. Otherwise
        the voice command won't be recognized.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are having trouble getting Wear OS to recognize what you said you
        can use the feature that lets you edit the recognized text.
      </p>
      <h3 id="color-customization">Color Customization</h3>
      <p>
        You can change the color theme of the Ultimatrix and Omniverse modes.
        You can choose between 12 different colors! To change colors you need to
        have the Alien Watch Companion app for Android and go into the settings
        screen. Available colors: dark blue, light blue, green (classic), lime,
        orange, yellow, pink, purple, cyan, grey, brown and red (albedo).
      </p>
      <p>
        You can change the color theme of Ultimatrix and Omniverse using the
        <a href="#preferences-editor">Preferences Editor</a> directly on your
        watch without the need to use the Companion app for Android.
      </p>

      <h3 id="albedo">Albedo</h3>
      <p>
        Activation sequence: R, R, L, R, R, L, L, R, L, L.
        <br />
        <br />
        Albedo mode is a special color customization option which can't be
        selected in the Companion app. Albedo mode needs to be activated using
        the activation sequence above when in Ultimatrix or Omniverse mode.
        <br />
        <br />
        Albedo mode has higher priority than the color theme selected using the
        Companion app and it will override it. However, you can return to the
        color theme selected in the Companion or the deafult color theme by
        disabling Albedo mode eg. using the same sequence you used to activate
        Albedo mode.
      </p>
      <h3 id="screensaver">Screensaver</h3>
      <p>
        Screensaver or Ambient mode is the mode that's activated after you
        perform the palm gesture eg. cover your watch screen with your palm. The
        screen will become darker and a clock will appear on the screen.
        Depending on the mode which is currently active (Prototype, Ultimatrix
        or Omniverse) a different background will be used.
        <br />
        <br />
        Currently there's no way to keep Alien Watch as a watch face, but this
        is a pretty good alternative.
      </p>
      <h3 id="preferences-editor">Preferences Editor</h3>
      <p>
        Activation sequence: L, R, R, L, R, R, L, R, R, L.
        <br />
        <br />
        You can activate the preferences editor in all modes. It allows you to
        quickly change your preferences (settings) directly on Wear OS, without
        the need to open the Alien Watch Companion app for Android. All of the
        above can be changed using the Preferences Editor.
      </p>
      <b>Selector Speed</b>
      <p>
        You can change the selector speed (the speed at which alien selection
        animations happen) for Ultimatrix mode and Omniverse mode.
      </p>
      <b>Back Button Activation</b>
      <p>
        A Prototype mode exclusive feature is the ability to require the back
        button (physical back button on your Wear OS device) to be pressed in
        order for the app to be activated.
