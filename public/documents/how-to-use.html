      <h1>Prototype</h1>
      <p>
        Prototype mode is the deafult mode. You can return to Prototype mode
        while in <a href="#ultimatrix">Ultimatrix mode</a> by using the
        Ultimatrix mode activation sequence. <br /><br />
        In Prototype mode you have access to the 10 original aliens by default.
        The default transformation and cooldown durations are 30 seconds, but
        can be customized using the Alien Watch Companion app for Android or
        using the <a href="#preferences-editor">Preferences Editor</a> on your
        Wear OS device. <br /><br />

        Prototype mode contains:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Master Control</li>
        <li>DNA Scan</li>
        <li>Self Destruction</li>
        <li>Fusion Transformations</li>
        <li>Virtual Reality Transformations</li>
        <li>Malfunctioned Transformations</li>
        <li>Other features</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Prototype Master Control</h3>
      <p>
        Activation sequence: <code>L, R, L, R, L, R, L, R, L, R</code>
        <br />
        <br />
        In Master Control mode you gain access to a total of 55 aliens (after
        you unlock them using DNA Scan).<br /><br />
        The transformations are infinite, meaning that you can stay transformed
        how long you want! Cooldowns don't require you wait before being able to
        transform again, meaning that you can exit cooldown whenever you like.
        <br /><br />There's also a quick transformation feature which you can
        use by long pressing the screen when your Omnitrix is locked.
      </p>
      <h3>Prototype DNA Scan</h3>
      <p style="color: red">
        DNA Scan requires Master Control and you need to allow Alien Watch to
        have the Activity Recognition permission on your Wear OS device!
      </p>
      <p>
        Initially you only have access to 10 aliens without Master Control and
        15 aliens with Master Control. In order to unlock more aliens (currently
        there's a totoal of 55 aliens) you will need to use DNA Scan.
        <br /><br />
        There are two approaches to using DNA Scan in Prototype mode:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Unlocking DNA Scan (by walking and reaching steps goals)</li>
        <li>Forcing DNA Scan (by using a cheat code)</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        If you want to complete DNA Scan (eg. unlock all aliens) without using
        cheats you will need to walk and reach step count goals that Alien Watch
        sets for you. After you reach the target step count you can enter the
        code for the DNA Scan activation.
        <br />
        <br />
        Step count progress check: <code>L, R, R, R, R, L, R, R, R, R</code>
        <br /><br />
        Attempt DNA Scan activation: <code>L, R, R, L, L, L, L, L, L, L</code>
        <br /><span style="color: red">
          This can only be used after reaching the target step count. It also
          requires Master Control.
        </span>
        <br /><br />
        Alien Watch tracks how much time it took you to unlock aliens. You can
        check your time in the DNA Scan progress check screen using the above
        mentioned activation code. After completing DNA Scan you will be able to
        submit your result to the Leaderboard in the Alien Watch Companion app
        for Android.
        <br /><br />
        If you don't want to submit your result to the Leaderboard you can use
        the code for forcing DNA Scan activation without having to reach the
        target step count.
        <br /><br />
        Force DNA Scan activation: <code>L, R, R, R, R, L, R, R, R, R</code>
        <br />
        <span style="color: red"
          >If you use this code you won't be able to submit your result to the
          Leaderboard.</span
        >
        <br /><br />
        How do I submit my result to the Leaderboard?
        <br />
        <br />
        After completing DNA Scan in Prototype mode open the Alien Watch
        Companion app for Android. If you don't have an Alien Watch account you
        will need to create it. After creating your account (or signing in)
        navigate to the Leaderboard screen and a prompt will appear asking you
        if you want to share your result to the Leaderboard.
      </p>
      <h3>Prototype Self Destruction</h3>
      <p>
        Activation sequence: <code>L, L, R, R, L, L, R, R, L, L</code>
        <br />
        <br />
        There are multiple phases in the Self Destruction sequence. After all of
        the phases are completed your Omnitrix will be explode! To cancel the
        Self Destruction you can use the same sequence you used to activate it.
      </p>
      <h3>Prototype Fusion transformations</h3>
      <p>
        Activation sequence: <code>L, R, L, R, R, L, R, L, R, R</code>
        <br />
        <br />
        After using the activation code you will first go through the activation
        animation. After the animation finishes you can click the center of the
        screen to perform the transformation. Just make sure that you attempt to
        perform the transformation when there's no electricity on the screen!
        <br />
        <br />
        To exit Fusion mode long press the screen in stead of clicking.
        <br />
        <br />
        All aliens seen in

        are available: Heat jaws (Heatblast + Rip jaws), Diamond matter
        (Diamondhead + Grey matter) and Stink arms (Stinkfly + Four arms).
      </p>
      <h3>Virtual Reality transformations</h3>
      <p>
        <span style="color: red"
          >Not all smartphones support VR.

      <h3>Malfunctioned Transformations</h3>
      <p>
        If you double tap (instead of tapping once) to perform a transformation
        the Omnitrix will malfunction and it won't transform you into the alien
        you actually selected. This will trigger a special animation which will
        reveal which alien you transformed into.
      </p>
      <h3>Other Features</h3>
      <h3>Cancel Alien Selection</h3>
      You can cancel alien selection by pressing the back button or long
      pressing the center of the screen if your watch automatically exits the
      app after you press the back button. This will trigger a speical animation
      which will bring your Omnitrix back into locked state.
      <h3>Randomize Alien Order</h3>
      If you enable this then the order of aliens will be randomized and you
      will get a random alien every time you switch to the right or to the left.
      <h3>Instant Alien Switching</h3>
      If you enable this there won't be a switching animation and you will be
      able to cycle between aliens instantly.
      <h3>Cosmetic Customization</h3>
      Prototype mode supports some costmetic settings which allow you to
      configure the look of your Prototype Omnitrix to your liking. You can
      enable or disable shadows and realistic effects.
      <br /><br />If realistic effects are off the background of alien selection
      won't be animated and the black borders on the sides won't be shiny.

    <section id="ultimatrix">
      <h1>Ultimatrix</h1>
      <p>
        Activation sequence: <code>L, L, L, R, L, R, L, R, L, R</code>
        <br />
        <br />
        You can activate Ultimatrix by using it's activation sequence when in
        <a href="#prototype">Prototype mode</a>. You can also return to
        Ultimatrix mode from <a href="#omniverse">Omniverse mode</a> by using
        the Omniverse mode activation sequence.
        <br />
        <br />
        In Ultimatrix mode you have access to a total of 34 aliens. You can
        perform ultimate transformations with 9 of those aliens, while 32 scream
        their name when performing a normal transformation.
        <br />
        <br />
        Aliens which currently scream their name when transforming: Swampfire,
        Humungousaur, Spidermonkey, Four Arms, Big Chill, Jetray, Goop, Echo
        Echo, Ghostfreak, Chromastone, Brainstorm, Way Big, Alien X, Rath,

        Armodrillo, NRG, Ampfibian, Zs'Skayr, Lodestar, Nanomech, Chamalien,
        Eatle, Fasttrack, Clockwork, Juryrigg.
        <br />
        <br />

        You can disable the sound effects of aliens screaming their voices using
        the
        <a href="#preferences-editor">Preferences Editor</a>.

        <br />
        <br />

        Ultimatrix mode contains:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Master Control</li>
        <li>Self Destruction</li>
        <li>Ultimate Trasnformations (Evolved Forms)</li>
        <li>Other features</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Ultimatrix Master Control</h3>
      <p>
        Activation sequence: <code>L, R, L, R, L, R, L, R, L, R</code>
        <br /><br />
        Master Control enables quick transformations and ultimate
        transformations. To perform quick transformations you need to long press
        the screen when the Ultimatrix is locked. Read more about ultimate
        transformations below.
        <br />
        <br />
        Unlike Prototype mode where the Master Control state is persisent in
        Ultimatrix mode you need to activate Master Control every time you open
        the app.
      </p>
      <h3>Azmuth Easter Egg</h3>
      <p>
        Ultimatrix Master Control contains a little easter egg. When you attempt
        to activate Master Control there's a 20% chance that the activation will
        fail. If that happens Azmuth will appear on the screen warning you about
        messing with the Omnitrix.
      </p>
      <h3>Ultimatrix Self Destruction</h3>
      <p>
        Activation sequence: <code>L, L, R, R, L, L, R, R, L, L</code>
        <br />
        <br />
        There are multiple phases in the Self Destruction sequence. The complete
        sequence lasts about 30 seconds not including the activation animation.
        After all of the phases are completed your Omnitrix will be explode!
        <br />
        <br />
        In the Ultimatrix Self Destruction sequence there's also a countdown.
        The Ultimatrix speaks to let you know how much time's left before the
        detonation.
        <br />
        <br />
        To cancel the Self Destruction you can use the same sequence you used to
        activate it. But, make sure you cancel on time because you can't abort
        if there's less than five seconds on the countdown.
      </p>
      <h3>Ultimate Transformations</h3>
      <p>
        Ultimate transformations are available only when Master Control is
        enabled.
        <br />
        <br />
        After performing the regular transformation instead of clicking the
        screen, to go into cooldown, you need to long press the screen. The
        ultimate transformation sound effect and animation will play, after
        which the evolved alien will appear.
        <br />
        <br />
        Aliens which support ultimate transformations: Swampfire, Humangosaur,
        Spidermonkey, Big Chill, Echo Echo, Ghostfreak, Way Big, Cannonbolt,
        Wildmutt.
      </p>

      pressing the center of the screen if your watch automatically exits the
      app after you press the back button. This will trigger a speical animation
      which will bring your Omnitrix back into locked state.
      <h3>Randomize Alien Order</h3>
      If you enable this then the order of aliens will be randomized and you
      will get a random alien every time you switch to the right or to the left.
      <h3>Instant Alien Switching</h3>
      If you enable this there won't be a switching animation and you will be
      able to cycle between aliens instantly.
      <h3>3D Alien Switching Effect</h3>
      If you enable this an animation will be played which will make it look
      like the aliens are coming out of the screen. This option only applies to
      the alien selection part of Ultimatrix mode and the app will revert back
      to normal after you stop selecting aliens. Check it out, you might like
      it.
    </section>
    <section id="omniverse">
      <h1>Omniverse</h1>
      <p>
        Activation sequence: <code>R, R, R, L, R, L, R, L, R, L</code>
        <br />
        <br />
        You can activate Omniverse by using it's activation sequence when in
        <a href="#ultimatrix">Ultimatrix mode</a>.
        <br />
        <br />
        To show the selector and start switching aliens you need to long press
        the screen. Once the selector is visible you must not take your finger
        of the screen.
        <br />
        <br />
        To switch aliens to the right (clockwise) you need to drag your finger
        to the right side of the screen. To switch aliens to the left
        (counter-clockwise) you need to drag your finger to the left side of the
        screen.
        <br />
        <br />
        Once you select the alien you want to transform into, bring your finger
        to the center of the screen and lift it of the screen. You will hear a
        beeping sound. To perform the actual transformation you need to tap the
        center of the screen one more time.
        <br />
        <br />
        Omniverse contains one other sub-mode:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Randomizer Function</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Randomizer Function</h3>
      <p>
        Activation sequence: <code>R, L, L, L, R, R, L, L, L, R</code>
        <br />
        <br />
        The Randomizer function can be activated when your Omnitrix is locked.
        After activating the Randomizer Function you will get a random alien
        about every 15 seconds. You can disable the Randomizer function by using
        the same sequence you used to activate it.
      </p>
      <h3>Life Form Lock</h3>
      <p>
        Activation sequence: <code>L, L, L, R, R, R, L, L, L, L</code>
        <br />
        <br />
        Omniverse transformations only last 10 seconds. However, you can stay
        transformed how long you want by activating Life Form Lock using the
        above mentioned activation sequence.
        <br /><br />
        To activate Life Form Lock, first select an alien using the selector
        wheel. Once you have selected the alien and you start hearing the
        continous beeping sound you need to long press the screen. The screen
        content should shrink and now you can use the above mentioned activation
        sequence to activate Life Form Lock. You can return to the previous
        state (eg. cancel Life Form Lock activation) by long pressing the screen
        again.
        <br /><br />
        When Life Form Lock is activated you won't transform back automatically
        until you remove the Life Form Lock cover. You can do that by dragging
        the cover (swiping on your screen) towards the top of the screen.

        If you are having trouble getting Wear OS to recognize what you said you
        can use the feature that lets you edit the recognized text.

      <h3 id="color-customization">Color Customization</h3>
      <p>
        All three modes (Prototype, Ultimatrix and Omniverse) support color
        customization using the
        <a href="#preferences-editor">Preferences Editor</a>.
        <br />
        <br />
        Prototype mode and Ultimatrix mode allow you to pick any color for your
        color theme! You can pick any color you want using a color picker.
        Omniverse mode currently only supports the 12 predefined color themes.
      </p>

      <h3 id="design-customization">Design Customization</h3>
      <p>
        Prototype mode and Ultimatrix mode support design customization. You can
        pick between two different designs using the
        <a href="#preferences-editor">Preferences Editor</a>.
      </p>

      <h3 id="albedo">Albedo</h3>
      <p>
        Activation sequence: <code>R, R, L, R, R, L, L, R, L, L</code>
        <br />
        <br />
        Albedo mode is a special color customization option which can't be
        selected in the Companion app. Albedo mode needs to be activated using
        the activation sequence above when in Ultimatrix or Omniverse mode.
        <br />
        <br />
        Albedo mode has higher priority than the color theme selected using the
        Companion app and it will override it. However, you can return to the
        color theme selected in the Companion or the deafult color theme by
        disabling Albedo mode eg. using the same sequence you used to activate
        Albedo mode.
      </p>
      <h3 id="screensaver">Screensaver</h3>
      <p>
        Screensaver or Ambient mode is the mode that's activated after you
        perform the palm gesture eg. cover your watch screen with your palm. The
        screen will become darker and a clock will appear on the screen.
        <br />
        <br />
        Currently there's no way to keep Alien Watch as a watch face, but this
        is a pretty good alternative.
      </p>
      <h3 id="preferences-editor">Preferences Editor</h3>
      <p>
        Activation sequence: <code>L, R, R, L, R, R, L, R, R, L</code>
        <br />
        <br />
        You can activate the preferences editor in all modes. It allows you to
        quickly change your preferences (settings) directly on Wear OS, without
        the need to open the Alien Watch Companion app for Android. All of the
        above can be changed using the Preferences Editor.
      </p>
      <b>Selector Speed</b>
      <p>
        You can change the selector speed (the speed at which alien selection
        animations happen) for Ultimatrix mode and Omniverse mode.
      </p>
      <b>Back Button Activation</b>
      <p>
        A Prototype mode exclusive feature is the ability to require the back
        button (physical back button on your Wear OS device) to be pressed in
        order for the app to be activated.
      </p>
      <b>Keep Screen On</b>
      <p>
        If you enable this Alien Watch will prevent the screen from
        automatically going into sleep because of inactivity.
